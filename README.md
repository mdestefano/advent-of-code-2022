# Advent of Code 

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## 2022
I tried to solve as many as possible, but I didn't have time to finish them all. I solved the challenges up to day 12.
I used [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the solutions, which is my go-to language, to try to get as better as possible at it.

## 2023
I am using this as an opportunity to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), so the solutions are written in Rust.
