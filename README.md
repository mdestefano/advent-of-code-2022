# Advent of Code 2022

This year I decided to dive into [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
In this repository I will put all my code for solving the puzzles.
I know, it's Python, but now it's my main language. Or better, my primary used language.

The repo is organized by days.
Each folder is a day, and inside there is the code for both the puzzles in the day.
